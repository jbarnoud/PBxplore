Regression tests for PBxplore.

This script run the various PBxplore programs with various argument, and makes
sure the output is the expected one. The aim is to check that the programs are
not broken during development.

Be careful this script does not test that the output is right. It just test that
the output is the expected one based on previous a previous version.

To run this test suite, you can either run this script without arguments or use
the nose [1]_ package. The latter option gives a more readable output, as stdout
is captured, and is displayed only if a test fails.
